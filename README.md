Learning physical properties from crystal structure

The Order_Parameters jupyter notebook file calculates atomic-species-aware and directionally biased order parameters. The script requires the configuration files that are provided in the corresponding folders.
The example configurations are all 16 atoms (two conventional cells). The examples are:
1) SiGe (4 monolayers / 4 monolayers) superlattice on Si substrate
2) SiGe (4 monolayers / 4 monolayers) superlattice on Ge substrate
3) SiGe random alloy
